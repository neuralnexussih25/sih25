The Pandavas are born to Queen Kunti, conceived by divine will. Their arrival instantly stirs jealousy in their maternal uncle Duryodhana, who schemes against them with his brothers, the Kauravas, setting a stage for conflict within Hastinapura itself. A desperate gambler, Dushyanta's son Dhritarashtra faces ruin until his blind elder brother Vidur convinces him to seek counsel.
His youngest son, Duryodhana, mocks the Pandava prince Yudhishthira with a rigged dice game, wagering not just wealth but ultimately, his dear sister Draupadi. The epic concludes with the devastating Kurukshetra war between all surviving sons of Dhritarashtra and Kunti's five Pandava sons. Fought amidst profound moral quandaries regarding dharma, it becomes a final, bloody testament to ambition, honor, and the complex interplay of fate on the mortal plane.
